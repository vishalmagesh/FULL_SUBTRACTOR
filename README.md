# FULL_SUBTRACTOR
# Aim
To simulate and synthesis full subtractor using Xilinx ISE.

# Apparatus Required
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

# Procedure

STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:11 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

# Program
```
module full_subtractor(a,b,c,diff,borr); 
input a,b,c;
output diff,borr; 
wire w1,w2,w3,w4; 
xor s1(w1,a,b); 
not s3(w2,w1); 
not s4(w4,c); 
and s5(y,w4,b); 
xor s2(diff,a,w1); 
and s6(w3,w2,a); 
or (borr,y,w3); 
endmodule
```
# Output
![316579721-96b1f65d-a5c7-4c1e-9a74-3c67f5804329](https://github.com/vishalmagesh/FULL_SUBTRACTOR/assets/160302888/b81f44f7-5976-4a40-8aab-79d1797b8a5e)
# Result
Hence full subtractor was simulated and verified.
