# FULL_SUBTRACTOR
# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis full subtractor using Xilinx ISE.

# Apparatus Required:
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

# Program
```
module full_subtractor(a,b,c,diff,borr);
input a,b,c;
output diff,borr;
wire w1,w2,w3,w4;
xor s1(w1,a,b);
not s3(w2,w1);
not s4(w4,c);
and s5(y,w4,b);
xor s2(diff,a,w1);
and s6(w3,w2,a);
or (borr,y,w3);
endmodule
```
# Output
![313525192-cba73d10-46c7-45ba-a0d9-0a95cb895b64](https://github.com/RESMIRNAIR/FULL_SUBTRACTOR/assets/160302888/a2a4da47-cca1-4d06-9177-78e925d4f51b)
# Result
Hence Full Subtractor Verified.
